										<h4>PolarCAP – A deep learning approach for first motion polarity classification of earthquake waveforms</h4>
										<h5><font color="LemonChiffon">Chakraborty M.</font>, C.Q. Cartaya, W. Li, J. Faber, G. Rümpker, H. Stoecker and N. Srivastava</h5>
									</header>
									<p>The polarity of first P-wave arrivals plays a significant role in the effective determination of focal mechanisms specially for smaller earthquakes. Manual estimation of polarities is not only time-consuming but also prone to human errors. This warrants a need for an automated algorithm for first motion polarity determination. We present a deep learning model - PolarCAP that uses an autoencoder architecture to identify first-motion polarities of earth-quake waveforms. PolarCAP is trained in a supervised fashion using more than 130,000 labelled traces from the Italian seismic dataset (INSTANCE) and is cross-validated on 22,000 traces to choose the most optimal set of hyperparameters. We obtain an accuracy of 0.98 on a completely unseen test dataset of almost 33,000 traces. Furthermore, We check the model gen-eralizability by testing it on the datasets provided by previous works and show that our model achieves a higher recall on both positive and negative polarities.</p>

										<h4>CREIME—A Convolutional Recurrent Model for Earthquake Identification and Magnitude Estimation</h4>
										<h5><font color="LemonChiffon">Chakraborty M.</font>, D. Fenner, W. Li, J. Faber, K. Zhou, G. Rümpker, H. Stoecker and N. Srivastava</h5>
									</header>
									<p>The detection and rapid characterization of earthquake parameters such as magnitude are important in real‐time seismological applications such as Earthquake Monitoring and Earthquake Early Warning (EEW). Traditional methods, aside from requiring extensive human involvement can be sensitive to signal‐to‐noise ratio leading to false/missed alarms depending on the threshold. We here propose a multitasking deep learning model—the Convolutional Recurrent model for Earthquake Identification and Magnitude Estimation (CREIME) that: (a) detects the earthquake signal from background seismic noise, (b) determines the first P wave arrival time, and (c) estimates the magnitude using the raw three‐component waveforms from a single station as model input. Considering, that speed is essential in EEW, we use up to 2 s of P wave information which, to the best of our knowledge, is a significantly smaller data window compared to the previous studies. To examine the robustness of CREIME, we test it on two independent data sets and find that it achieves an average accuracy of 98% for event versus noise discrimination and can estimate first P‐arrival time and local magnitude with average root mean squared errors of 0.13 s and 0.65 units, respectively. We compare CREIME with traditional methods such as short‐term‐average/long‐term‐average (STA/LTA) and show that CREIME has superior performance, for example, the accuracy for signal and noise discrimination is higher by 4.5% and 11.5%, respectively, for the two data sets. We also compare the architecture of CREIME with the architectures of other baseline models, trained on the same data, and show that CREIME outperforms the baseline models.</p>

										<h4>Automated Seismo-Volcanic Event Detection Applied to Stromboli (Italy)</h4>
										<h5>Fenner D., G. Rümpker, W. Li, <font color="LemonChiffon">M. Chakraborty</font>, J. Faber, J. Köhler, H. Stoecker and N. Srivastava</h5>
									</header>
									<p>Many active volcanoes exhibit Strombolian activity, which is typically characterized by relatively frequent mild volcanic explosions and also by rare and much more destructive major explosions and paroxysms. Detailed analyses of past major and minor events can help to understand the eruptive behavior of volcanoes and the underlying physical and chemical processes. Catalogs of these eruptions and, specifically, seismo-volcanic events may be generated using continuous seismic recordings at stations in the proximity of volcanoes. However, in many cases, the analysis of the recordings relies heavily on the manual picking of events by human experts. Recently developed Machine Learning-based approaches require large training data sets which may not be available a priori. Here, we propose an alternative user-friendly, time-saving, automated approach labelled as: the A daptive- W indow Volcanic E vent S election A nalysis M odule (AWESAM). This strategy of creating seismo-volcanic event catalogs consists of three main steps: 1) identification of potential volcanic events based on squared ground-velocity amplitudes, an adaptive MaxFilter, and a prominence threshold. 2) catalog consolidation by comparing and verifying the initial detections based on recordings from two different seismic stations. 3) identification and exclusion of signals from regional tectonic earthquakes. The strength of the python package is the reliable detection of very small and frequent events as well as major explosions and paroxysms. Here, it is applied to publicly accessible continuous seismic recordings from two almost equidistant stations at Stromboli volcano in Italy. We tested AWESAM by comparison with a hand-picked catalog and found that around 95% of the seismo-volcanic events with a signal-to-noise ratio above three are detected. In a first application, we derive a new amplitude-frequency relationship from over 290.000 seismo-volcanic events at Stromboli during 2019–2020 which were detected by AWESAM. The module allows for a straightforward generalization and application to other volcanoes with frequent Strombolian activity worldwide. Furthermore, this module can be implemented for volcanoes with rarer explosions.</p>

										<h4>Structural geological interpretations from 1 unrolled images of drill cores</h4>
										<h5><font color="LemonChiffon">Chakraborty M.</font> and S. Mukherjee</h5>
									</header>
									<p>Structures hidden at depth can be assessed through drill cores recovered from them. A crucial part of petroleum geology study is to interpret structures from these cores collected from vertical and inclined drilling operations reaching different depths. We deduce analytically ideal structures in unrolled/unwrapped images of cylindrical drill cores. These structures are: (i) orthogonal and conjugate fractures, (ii) single generation periodic folds and type-1 and type-2 superposed folds, (iii) listric faults and (iv) different types of angular unconformities. The sinuous curves as found in unrolled images are not always characteristic of the structures. Therefore accurate identification of structures would require additional information, such as the drill core itself.</p>

										<h4>3-D slip analyses of listric faults with ideal geometries</h4>
										<h5>Mukherjee S. and <font color="LemonChiffon">M. Chakraborty</font></h5>
									</header>
									<p>Studying the kinematics of listric faults is of great importance in petroleum geology and seismicity. The deformation related to listric faults differ from the planar fault plane case. This study involves 3-D coordinate geometry with spherical coordinates to deduce the effective-slip (es) and the net-slip (ns) of listric faults of three ideal geometries: spherical, paraboloid and ellipsoidal. Previous authors have considered these shapes of fault planes in their modeling. Using the es, one can track material points before and after faulting, similar to Mukherjee (2019) applied on translational faults with planar fault planes. The ns can be divided into a strike-slip (s ns) and a dip-slip component (d ns). This resolution being done on the curved fault plane itself, ns = (s 2 ns + d 2 ns) 0.5. This is unlike the planar fault plane case. We perform 3D slip analyses on two types of listric faults (Type-1 and 2).</p>
